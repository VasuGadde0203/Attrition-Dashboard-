# Attrition-Dashboard-

Overview
This project is focused on building an Employee Attrition Dashboard to help organizations identify and analyze patterns in employee turnover. The dashboard visualizes key metrics related to employee attrition, such as turnover rates, reasons for attrition, and the impact of factors like age, department, and salary on employee retention. By providing a comprehensive overview, this dashboard can assist HR teams and business leaders in making data-driven decisions to reduce employee churn.

Features
Interactive Visualizations: Charts, graphs, and KPIs to track employee attrition trends.
Filtering Options: Filter data by department, age group, job role, etc., to dive deeper into the specific causes of attrition.
Key Metrics: Monthly attrition rates, department-wise attrition, and reason breakdown.
Predictive Insights: Analysis of factors contributing to higher attrition, such as job satisfaction and employee performance.

Data
The dataset used for this dashboard contains anonymized employee records, including factors such as:
Age
Gender
Department
Job Role
Salary
Performance Ratings
Work Experience
Reasons for Attrition (voluntary, involuntary, retirement, etc.)

Usage
Filtering: Use the filters to focus on specific departments, job roles, or other criteria.
Dashboard Navigation: Explore the tabs and visualizations to gain insights into employee attrition trends.
Export: If available, export data and reports in various formats (CSV, Excel, PDF).

Future Improvements
Predictive Analytics: Incorporating machine learning to predict potential employee attrition.
Automated Reporting: Email or scheduled reporting features.
Enhanced Data Sources: Integration with external data sources such as HR systems for real-time updates.

Conclusion - 
Based on the analysis provided by the Employee Attrition Dashboard, we can draw the following key conclusions:

Age Group: Employees between the ages of 26 - 35 are more likely to leave the company.
Educational Background: Employees with educational backgrounds in Life Sciences and Medical fields show higher attrition rates compared to other disciplines.
Salary Range: Employees earning a salary of above 15,000 tend to leave more frequently, suggesting that salary may not be the primary factor driving retention for this group.
Tenure: The highest turnover occurs after 3 - 4 years of employment, indicating a potential retention issue during this critical period.
Job Roles: The job roles most affected by attrition are Sales Executives and Research Scientists, highlighting specific areas where targeted retention strategies may be necessary.

These findings suggest that attrition is concentrated in a specific demographic, particularly employees who are well-educated, relatively young, and experienced in their roles. Addressing the needs and concerns of this group—whether through enhanced career development opportunities, better work-life balance, or more tailored compensation—could significantly reduce employee turnover.
